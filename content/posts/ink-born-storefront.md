# Ink-Born Storefront

> How we turned a plain shop into a page-turner.

Welcome to Hoshiya — an ecommerce experience sketched in bold black and white. We built:

- A hero with manga panels and SFX
- A real-feel cart and checkout
- Wishlist + Compare + Quick Add
- Fuzzy search with chips and “Did you mean…?”

## Why ink?
Ink gives motion and clarity without noise. Our UI leans on:

- Panel framing and halftones
- Speed lines and wipes
- Bold type and high contrast
