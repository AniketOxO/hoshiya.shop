    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: October 9, 2025</p>
    <p>This Refund Policy explains how refunds are handled after a return has been approved and received by Hoshiya.</p>

    <h2>Processing Time</h2>
    <p>After we receive and inspect a returned item, approved refunds are typically processed within 7–14 business days. The time it takes for the refund to appear in your account may vary by payment provider.</p>

    <h2>Method of Refund</h2>
    <p>Refunds are issued to the original payment method where possible. If the original payment method is unavailable, we will work with you to process the refund another way.</p>

    <h2>Shipping & Fees</h2>
    <p>Original shipping charges are non-refundable unless the return is due to an error on our part (damaged, defective, or incorrect item). Return shipping costs are generally the responsibility of the customer unless otherwise stated.</p>

    <h2>Partial Refunds & Deductions</h2>
    <p>Partial refunds may be granted for items that are not in their original condition, are damaged, or missing parts for reasons not due to our error. We will communicate any deductions prior to issuing the refund.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about a refund, contact <a href="mailto:ezyarohaclo@gmail.com">ezyarohaclo@gmail.com</a> with your order number.</p>
