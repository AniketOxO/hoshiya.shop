    <h2>Eligibility</h2>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will notify you about the status of your refund. If approved, refunds will be issued to the original method of payment within 7–14 business days. Shipping charges may be deducted unless the return is due to our error.</p>
